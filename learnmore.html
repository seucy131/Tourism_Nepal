			<h2 align="center"><u>Problems of Tourism</u></h2>
      Though tourism industry has a very high potential. However, Nepal is not able to sufficiently develop this sector. And the problem/ changelles of tourism are:<br><br>
<ul>
   <li><h3>Poor transportation and communication facilities:</h3><br>
                  Transportation and communication are the two main pillars of a modern era. These facilities are required for the development of the tourism sector. But there is lack of modern transportation and communication facility in Nepal. Due to it tourism sector is not well developed in Nepal .</li><br>
       
       
<li><h3>Lack of recreation facilities:</h3><br>
                    Recreation is an important part of human life. In Nepal; means of recreation like clubs,park, rafting, boating,etc are very limited. Therefore, the average length of stay at present for a tourists in Nepal is only about 13 days.
                </li><br>
 
  <li><h3>Lack of development of tourists sites:</h3><br> 
 Really speaking Nepal is full and preasent places. Rara, Dhorpatan, hile, Shreenagar, etc are the examples. But this places are not yet develop as tourists sites. Thus, tourist visiting Nepal return back to their country by staying only in Pokhara, Kathmandu, chitwan. </li><br>
    
<li><h3>Lack of tourists center and security:</h3><br>
      Tourism centres have been established in Nepal only in limited places. These centers provide different tourism services like information about pleasant places, tourism maps, exchanging foreign currency etc for tourists. Due to limited tourists centers, there is possiblities 
For tourists to be cheated. In some places tourists have been robbed. Thus lack of tourism centers and proper security arrangements are a great deterrent to the development of tourism in Nepal .</li><br>
  
  <li> <h3> Lack of quality of hotels:</h3><br>
Good qualyof hotels and lodges are the choice of tourists. But, such good quality hotels and lodges are limited numbers in Nepal. Most of these are concentrated only in Kathmandu valley which limits/stops foreign tourists only in Kathmandu valley.</li>
